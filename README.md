# Coding Challenge

Welcome to the coding challenge! In this challenge, you will have the opportunity to showcase your programming skills and problem-solving abilities. 

## Objective

The objective of this coding challenge is to create a web app using Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESlint. The app should implement state management using React Query for server-side data and Zustand for global state. Additionally, local state should be managed using useState. The app should also integrate with Supabase for CRUD operations on book data.

## Tasks

To complete this coding challenge, you should accomplish the following tasks:

1. Create a custom hook and use it as part of your solution for the remaining tasks.
2. Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for the book data between React Native and Supabase.
3. Create a menu animation that smoothly transitions between different frames when selecting menu tabs. The menu names can be "First", "Second", and "Third".

## Data

The book data should include the following fields:

- id
- title
- author
- publishedDate
- genre

## Menu Animation

You have the freedom to animate between the two states however you want.

## How We Assess Your Solution

We will assess your solution based on the following criteria:

- Functionality: Does the app work as expected?
- Code Quality: Does the code follow modern best practices and is it easy to read and maintain?
- UI/UX: While we don't expect a complete app, we would like to see some thought put into the appearance of the UI and how it scales across different screen sizes.

Please note that comprehensive UI/UX and artwork are not expected for this challenge.

Good luck and happy coding!
